===========

SongCi is a multi-modal deep learning model tailored for forensic pathological analyses.
The architecture consists of three main parts, i.e., an imaging encoder for WSI feature extraction, a text encoder for the embedding of gross key findings as well as diagnostic queries, and a multi-modal fusion block that integrates the embeddings of WSI and gross key findings to align with those of the diagnostic queries.
